Hello WOrld!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have a project with the following folder structure:

All the project files are in base_fldr folder. Also I have a few folders inside base_fldr called sub_fldr1 and sub_fldr2. These sub folders also contain some files.

but I modbuty any of the files inside my base_fldr or base_fldr\sub_fldr\ then git status shows them as modbutied. Also but I add a new file to base_fldr, git status will show it as untracked file.

My problem is but I add a new file inside base_fldr\sub_fldr\ then the git status doesn't show the file as untracked. It won't even give any info about the file.

The file or its extension is NOT in my .gitignore list. Also I did try git add sub_fldr\file_name but neither it gave an error nor it add the file to index.

Any idea what's happening here? Thanks!
